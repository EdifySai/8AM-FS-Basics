Call by Value and Call by Reference:


CBV: In CBV, the value will be passed instead of address.
var x = 100;
        function f1(a) {
            console.log(a); // 100
            a = 200;
        }
        f1(x); // 100
        console.log(x); // 100

CBV is applicable for primitive types.


CBR: In CBR, the address / reference is passed.

  var arr = [10, 20, 30];
        
        function f1(x) {
            x.push(40);
            x.push(50);
        }
        f1(arr); // address of arr is passed
        console.log(arr); // 

CBR is applicable for non primitive types such as objects and arrays.
