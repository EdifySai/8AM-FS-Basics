Debugging:

It is the process of finding the issues in the code by going line by line 
in the functionality. 

When a QA raises a bug, then that bug must be resolved. to understand 
which part of the code is raising a bug, we need to perform debugging.

        function checkEligibility(age) {
            if (typeof age != "number") {
                console.log("only numbers are allowed");
                return;
            }
            if (age >= 18) {
                console.log("eligible to vote")
            }
            else {
                console.log("not eligible to vote")
            }
        }

Garbage Collection:

It is the process where the unused/ orphan objects are removed from 
the memory when the threshold limit is reached.

Runtime Engine uses garbage collection (application) to remove the 
objects from the memory. 

As a developer, we need to focus on nullifying the objects after use. 

example:

var employee= {
    name:"kiran",
    address: "hyd"
}

console.log(employee.name);
console.log(employee.address);
employee = null;



Best coding practices:

1. Always use meaningful names for variables, functions,constants. 
  
      var isDownloadingFinished = true; 

      function getUsersBasedOnCountry(){

      }

      function filterDataBasedOnCriteria(criteria){

      }

    function name should always be verb.

2.  use  === instead of  == 

3. follow the naming conventions.

 for variables, use noun.
 for methods/ functions, use verb 
 constants -> should be uppercase 
 follow camelcase for variables, functions.

4. use tools like JSLint which warns us if we don't follow naming conventions.

5. Add necessary comments to the code. Don't write too many comments.
